# Jupyter Linker Extension

This is the Jupyter Notebook extension for the linker project.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Download and extract or clone this git repo.

Install by using `pip install linker_extension`

The install will automatically enable the server extension and install and enable the javascript extensions. This means that every notebook is set to load these extensions by default.
