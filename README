This is the Jupyter Notebook extension for the linker project. Install to the notebook by running the following commands after installing the overall package using pip:

jupyter serverextension enable --py linker_extension --system

jupyter nbextension install --overwrite --py linker_extension

jupyter nbextension enable --py linker_extension --system

This will enable the server extension and install and enable the javascript extensions. This will also mean that every notebook is set to load these extensions by default.

Also required is a file named "admin.txt" which contains login details for edata as a user that can access all repositories.

TODO: automate all the stuff below.

Templates need to go in /usr/local/lib/python[insert python version you are using here]/dist-packages/nbconvert/templates/latex/

admin.txt and blank.xml need to go in /srv/jupyterhub

custom.css to go in user's custom jupyter folder.
