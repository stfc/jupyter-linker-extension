This is the Jupyter Notebook extension for the linker project. Install to the notebook by running the following commands after installing the overall package using pip:

jupyter serverextension enable --py linker_extension --system

jupyter nbextension install --overwrite --py linker_extension

jupyter nbextension enable --py linker_extension --system

This will enable the server extension and install and enable the javascript extensions. This will also mean that every notebook is set to load these extensions by default.
